Old Portfolio Website
=============

My personal website from 2015.

# About 

Built with HTML/CSS/Javascript/jQuery/Bootstrap. No longer hosted anywhere (I'm not sure where most of the images are).

# TIL 

This was the first full website I made. It was also the first time I'd used jQuery and Boostrap for a project, which was very exciting at the time. I ended up overwriting a lot of Bootstrap's styling and functionality, which meant adding a lot of extra classes, and has made me very appreciative of more modern frameworks.
